This document describes how to turn a DMA module from generic input/output
ports into using TLM 2.0, then to put the DMA module into a RISC-V system.

In a system we need the architecture description and the software. In OVP
this is described in two directories, platform and application, respectively.

I. platform:

The platform directory contains the platform.cpp as the top level
module that describes the system, using OVP models and the SystemC
modules we developed. In this example we have a DMA, defined
in DMA.h and implemented in DMA.cpp.

I.i platform.cpp

platform.cpp is where sc_main() resides. In it clock and reset signals are
declared plus the top level module. In this example the top level module
is a SystemC module named as 'BareMetal', and instantiated as 'top'.

platform.cpp has to include all modules used. In this example we have
#include "tlmModule.hpp"
#include "tlm/tlmDecoder.hpp"
#include "tlm/tlmMemory.hpp"
#include "andes.ovpworld.org/processor/riscv/1.0/tlm/processor.igen.hpp"
#include "DMA.h"
#include "Adaptor.h"

to include the top level module tlmModule, bus module tlmDecoder,
RAM module tlmMemory, Andes RISC-V module and our own DMA module.

The BareMetal class defines all the resources needed: clock,  a tlmModule instantiated as Platform is the main body to house all resources,
i.e. processors, memories, busses, I/O and modules. Busses are declared
with tlmDecoder module, and RAM's are declared with tlmRam. In this example
we use Andes RISC-V module riscv. All of the above can be listed as:

class BareMetal : public sc_module {

public:
    BareMetal (sc_module_name name);
    sc_in <bool>          clk; // The clock port
    sc_in <bool>          clean; //The port to clear
    tlmModule             Platform; // The top level module
    tlmDecoder            bus1; //The bus to connect cpu /ram
    tlmRam                ram1; //ram 1 according to homework
    tlmRam                ram3;//ram 3 according to homework
    tlmRam                ram4;//ram 4 according to homework
    tlmRam                ram5;//ram 5  i design it for test write ram 
    riscv                 cpu1; //the riscv cpu
    DMA*                  dma1; //dma and it is a pointer
    Adaptor              adaptor1; //use to send interrput to cpu



BareMetal(sc_module_name name);

Notice that unlike all other OVP provided modules, our DMA modules does not
have the constructor DMA(tlmModule, char*, ...), we must code the instantiation
of the DMA and connect it to the system. Please refer to the code
for how to do module instantiations and connections.

I.ii Interrupt Adaptor
In the example provided the DMA interrupt and clear ports are removed.
It is because the interrupt port of RISC-V models on the OVP platform is
implemented with TLM 2.0 analysis port. In this project you are required
to implement an adaptor to transform the DMA bool type interrupt output
to the RISC-V analysis type interrupt input. Since there is no clear
supported on Andes N25 so the clear function remains shut.

I.iii Makefile

Please follow the Makefile provided to compile the platform. Notice how
to add module source code, e.g. DMA.cpp, into the SRC lable. Then we
leverage the Makefile OVP provides, Makefile.TLM.platform, to do the
make for us

II. application

In this example there is a test programs and the RISC-V interrupt code.
Two  programs is the DMA test program.
Interrupt code is required to be the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for
RISC-V to pick up the interrupt and transfer to the proper service routine.


II dmaTest.c, trap.S and riscvInterrupts.h

For a processor to handle interrupts a trap is needed to capture the interrupt,
which is an external hardware signal. This trap is implemented in trap.S, a
must to all applications that need to handle interrupts.

trap.S writes to a CSR (Control Status Register) for further handling. And
rescvInterrupts.h is the assembly code to handle CSR's and thus also a
must have code to handle interrupts.

dmaTest.c, is a combination of the DMA driver plus a test program. It
contains int_init() to initialized the interrupt handler (ISR, that is),
int_enable is then used to enable the interrupt. Some CSR write/read
functions, writeReg32(), readReg32(), writeReg8() and readReg8() are
provided to process CSR's. Finally interruptHandler(void) is the ISR.

When ISR is in place then dmaTest.c runs a test by first fill the
source memory with data. It then programs DMA control registers
to execute the data copy operation. Finally a check to read from
both source and target memories to see if the data has been successfully
copied.

III. Running the simulation

In DMA_project one can find  dma.sh. Execute


Execute dma.sh to:
1. cross compile the dmaTest.c with RISC-V corss compiler,
2. compile platform.cpp with the SystemC library,
3. then run the platform SystemC simulator with dmaTest loaded.
4. One can see the DMA testing processing in the SystemC simulation.
